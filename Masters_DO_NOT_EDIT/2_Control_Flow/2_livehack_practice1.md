A right-angled triangle has the property that when the values of the lengths of the sides are squared, the sum of the two smaller values is equal to the larger value. For example, 12, 5, and 13 make a right-angled triangle, because 12 * 12 = 144, 5 * 5 = 25, 13 * 13 = 169, and 144 + 25 = 169.

Write a function is_right_triangle(side_a, side_b, side_c) such that given three side lengths, returns `True` if the triangle created is a right-angled triangle, `False` if not.

Notes:
* Do not assume that the sides are given in order of smallest to greatest (i.e not necessarily side_a < side_b < side_c )
* side lengths are positive values
* include appropriate docstring a precondition(s)
* verify functionality with assert statements
