You have been working really hard at school and you're thinking about taking a summer vacation. You've discussed your thoughts with your parents and they told you that you can go away to Europe if you achieve an average 80% or greater and earn $500 before the summer.  If you do not earn $500 but still achieve an average 80% or over, you can go to California.  If you cannot achieve at least 80%, you don't get to go away.

Write a function `summer_vacation(mark, earnings)`, such that given `mark` and `earnings` values, returns `Europe`, `California`, or `Stay home` based on the scenario above . 

Notes:
* mark is between 0 and 100 inclusive
* earnings > 0
* include appropriate docstring and precondition(s)
* verify your function with assert statements
